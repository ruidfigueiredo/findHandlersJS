findHandlersJS
==============

Stop wasting your time looking for where those handlers are registered, use findHandlersJS and discover them instantly.

Usage: `findEventHandlers(eventType, jQuerySelector)`

Imagine you want to find all the "click" event handlers for all the buttons that are immediate children of the div with id="myDiv":

`findEventHandlers("click", "div#myDiv > :button")`

It will return an array with the element names, the `jQuery $._data` event information and the list of elements that that event handler covers (targets).

For example, if `div#myDiv` has a delegate handler with the selector `:button` and there is a button with `id="save"` inside the div, you would get this result:
```
[{
	element: div#myDiv,
	events: [{
		type: "click",
		handler: function() {...},
		namespace: "",
		selector: ":button",
		...
		targets: [button#save]			
	}]
}]
```

If you want to find any available events attached to the element, send "*" as first argument.

`findEventHandlers("*", "div#myDiv > :button")`

If you are using the console on Chrome, you can right click the handler, click show function definition and add  breakpoints to debug the handlers.
